This repo is an experiment of fusion of the classic 'one-package-per-system' style and the recent 'one-package-per-file' style.

The idea is simple.
**You can define functions or variables directly into 'one-package-per-system' symbols even in 'one-package-per-file' package.** I think this is simpler than defining external interfaces into a small package and re-exporting them.
